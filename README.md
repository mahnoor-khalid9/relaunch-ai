# 🔬 relaunch.ai — Startup Autopsy & Revival Engine

> *Why did it fail? How do you rebuild it?*

A multi-agent AI system built with **LangGraph** that takes any failed startup and produces a brutal post-mortem, a full relaunch strategy, and a mock marketing landing page — all generated by 5 specialized AI agents working in sequence.

## 🤖 The 5-Agent Pipeline

```
Research Agent → Autopsy Agent → Revival Strategist → Copywriter Agent → Marketing Page Agent
```

| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| 🔍 **Research Agent** | Builds a structured dossier — press coverage, founder commentary, community signals, competitor landscape, market conditions |
| 🩻 **Autopsy Agent** | 6-lens failure analysis (Timing, Market, PMF, Team, Competition, External) with a survival score |
| ⚡ **Revival Strategist** | Revised ICP, GTM strategy, 90-day roadmap, risk register |
| ✍️ **Copywriter Agent** | Autopsy summary card, one-page investor pitch, 30-second elevator pitch |
| 🚀 **Marketing Page Agent** | Full mock HTML landing page for the revived startup |

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Backend** — FastAPI + Python 3.12
- **Agent Orchestration** — LangGraph 0.2.x
- **LLM** — Deploy AI (GPT-4o) with dynamic mock fallback
- **Frontend** — Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (single file, no framework)
- **Deployment** — Docker, Railway, Render compatible

## 🚀 Running Locally

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahnoor-khalid9/relaunch-ai.git
cd relaunch-ai
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root:
```env
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
AUTH_URL=https://api-auth.deploy.ai/oauth2/token
API_URL=https://core-api.deploy.ai
ORG_ID=your_org_id
```
> **No API keys?** The app runs in **demo mode** automatically — all outputs are dynamically generated from your inputs with no hardcoded data.

### 4. Start the server
```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
